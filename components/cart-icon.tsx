```typescript
"use client";
import useStore from "@/store"; // Assuming this is where your cart data is stored
import { ShoppingBag } from "lucide-react";
import Link from "next/link";
import React from "react";

export default function CartIcon() {
  const { items } = useStore(); // Access cart items from your store
  return (
    <Link href={"/cart"} className="group relative">
      <ShoppingBag className="w-5 h-5 hover:text-shop_light_green hoverEffect" />
      <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 bg-shop_dark_green text-white h-3.5 w-3.5 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold flex items-center justify-center">
        {items?.length ? Math.min(items.length, 99) : 0} {/* Display cart item count, max 99 */}
      </span>
    </Link>
  );
};
```

Key changes and explanation:

* **`import useStore from "@/store";` and `const { items } = useStore();`**:  This is the crucial part. The original code commented out the usage of the `useStore` hook, which is (presumably) where the cart items are actually stored.  This code *must* be uncommented and functioning correctly for the cart count to be dynamic.  Make sure that `@/store` correctly exports a `useStore` hook that provides the cart `items`.  This hook should be using a state management library like Zustand, Redux, or Jotai (or a custom context solution).
* **`{items?.length ? Math.min(items.length, 99) : 0}`**: This conditional rendering displays the number of items in the cart.  It uses the `items?.length` (optional chaining) to gracefully handle the case where `items` might be initially `null` or `undefined`.  This prevents errors when the component first mounts before the store data is available.
    * **`items?.length ? ... : 0`**:  If `items` exists and has a length (i.e., the cart is not empty), then the first part of the ternary operator is executed. Otherwise, it displays "0".
    * **`Math.min(items.length, 99)`**:  This limits the displayed number of cart items to a maximum of 99.  If the cart has more than 99 items, it will display "99".  This is a common UI convention to prevent the number from overflowing the circle. If you truly need to display numbers above 99, you will need to adjust the size of the containing `span`.

Why the original code was wrong and why this fixes it:

The original code was displaying `0` because it was hardcoded to display `0`. The commented-out code *looked* like it should have displayed the correct count, but it wasn't actually being used. The fix involves:

1. **Uncommenting and properly using the `useStore` hook:**  This gets the actual cart data into the component.  The `useStore` hook *must* be correctly implemented and connected to your application's state management.
2. **Using a conditional to handle empty carts:** The `items?.length ? ... : 0` ensures that "0" is displayed when the cart is empty or the data hasn't loaded yet.
3. **Adding a maximum display value (optional):**  The `Math.min()` is a good practice to prevent the count from overflowing if the cart has a very large number of items.

**To use this solution, you *must* replace `"@/store"` with the actual path to your store and ensure that your store correctly manages the cart items.**  If you're not using Zustand or Redux, you'll need to adjust the store access accordingly.  For example, if you're using React Context, you would use `useContext` instead of `useStore`.

**Example using React Context:**

Assuming you have a context called `CartContext` with a `cartItems` property:

```typescript
"use client";
import { ShoppingBag } from "lucide-react";
import Link from "next/link";
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "@/context/CartContext"; // Replace with your actual path

export default function CartIcon() {
  const { cartItems } = useContext(CartContext);

  return (
    <Link href={"/cart"} className="group relative">
      <ShoppingBag className="w-5 h-5 hover:text-shop_light_green hoverEffect" />
      <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 bg-shop_dark_green text-white h-3.5 w-3.5 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold flex items-center justify-center">
        {cartItems?.length ? Math.min(cartItems.length, 99) : 0}
      </span>
    </Link>
  );
};
```

In this case, you'd also need to ensure that `CartContext` is defined and provides the `cartItems` data.  This context would typically be defined in a file like `src/context/CartContext.tsx`.

Remember to adjust the code to match your specific state management solution.  The core idea is to *get the cart item count from your store/context and display it dynamically*.
