```typescript
"use client";
import useStore from "@/store"; // Assuming this is your Zustand store
import { ShoppingBag } from "lucide-react";
import Link from "next/link";
import React from "react";

export default function CartIcon() {
  const { items } = useStore(); // Access the items from your store
  return (
    <Link href={"/cart"} className="group relative">
      <ShoppingBag className="w-5 h-5 hover:text-shop_light_green hoverEffect" />
      <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 bg-shop_dark_green text-white h-3.5 w-3.5 rounded-full text-xs font-semibold flex items-center justify-center">
        {items?.length ? items?.length : 100} {/* Changed 0 to 100 if items is null/undefined or empty  */}
      </span>
    </Link>
  );
};
```

**Explanation of the Fix and Why it Works:**

1. **Import `useStore`:** The original code commented out the `useStore` import.  This is crucial because it's how you access the cart items from your Zustand store (or any state management solution you're using).  I've uncommented it: `import useStore from "@/store";`.  *Make sure the path ` "@/store"` is correct for your project.*

2. **Access `items`:** The code now calls `const { items } = useStore();` to retrieve the `items` array (presumably an array of cart items) from your store.

3. **Conditional Rendering of the Count:** The key change is within the `<span>` element. I've modified the expression:

   ```javascript
   {items?.length ? items?.length : 100}
   ```

   * **`items?.length`:** This uses the optional chaining operator (`?.`). It safely checks if `items` is `null` or `undefined`. If it is, the whole expression evaluates to `undefined`, avoiding an error. If `items` exists, it then accesses the `length` property.
   * **`? items?.length`:**  If `items` exists and has a length (i.e., the cart is not empty), the cart count will be `items.length`.
   * **`: 100`:** If `items` is `null`, `undefined`, or has a length of `0` (the cart is empty), the expression evaluates to `100`. This satisfies the requirement to change the value from `0` to `100`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Zustand (or your state management library):** This fix assumes you're using Zustand or a similar state management library where you have a store that holds the cart items.  Ensure that your `useStore` hook is correctly configured to access your cart data.  If you're using a different method for managing state (e.g., React Context), you'll need to adjust the code accordingly to retrieve the `items` array.
* **Data Persistence:**  If your cart data is not persisted (e.g., in local storage or a database), the cart will be empty whenever the user refreshes the page. Consider implementing a mechanism to save and restore the cart data.
* **Error Handling:** You might want to add more robust error handling, especially if the `useStore` hook could potentially fail.
* **User Experience:** A cart item count of 100 when there are no items in the cart might be confusing for the user. Consider if `100` is really the correct fallback value or whether a different value or UI element would be more appropriate.

**How to Test:**

1. **Clear your cart:** Make sure your cart is empty (or doesn't exist in local storage/wherever it's stored).
2. **Run your application:** Start your Next.js development server.
3. **Check the cart icon:** The cart icon should now display "100" (if the cart is truly empty).
4. **Add items to your cart:**  Add items to your cart through your application's user interface.
5. **Verify the count updates:** The cart icon's count should now reflect the actual number of items in your cart.
6. **Refresh the page:**  The count should persist (if you have data persistence implemented). If not it will revert to 100.

This corrected code should resolve the reported issue while also being more robust and maintainable. Remember to adjust the store path (`@/store`) and data persistence as needed for your specific project.
